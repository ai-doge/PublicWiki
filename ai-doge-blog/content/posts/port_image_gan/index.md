# Implementing ImageGAN: A Journey from Data Collection to App Deployment

## Introduction

[Image GAN](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image-gan/id1637359196) is an innovative application that merges art and technology to create unique visuals. Utilizing advanced GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) algorithms, the app offers a range of features:

- **AI Landscapes**: Explore AI-generated landscapes that capture the beauty of nature in a novel way.
- **Dynamic Cloudscapes**: Experience ever-changing cloud patterns, curated solely by artificial intelligence.
- **AI Masterpieces**: Witness artistry as AI channels the essence of legendary painters to create new masterworks.

For those interested in the technical aspects, this blog post will walk you through the process of implementing ImageGAN, focusing on data preparation and model training.

## Part 1: Preparing Training Data

### Data Collection: Landscapes

To train our GAN model, we needed a dataset that was both high-quality and relevant to our application's focus on landscapes. We used web scraping techniques to collect free and commercially usable natural landscape photos. If you're interested, you can download the dataset from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zmHJS8DIqQ7vJmIFH4xoBYL7zHGi2-XO/view).

### Data Preprocessing

The collected images were preprocessed to fit the requirements of GAN training. Specifically, we resized the images to a uniform 512x512 pixel resolution. This step is crucial for the stability and effectiveness of the GAN model.

## Part 2: Training the Projected GAN Model

### Choosing an Open-Source Project

For the model training, we chose the open-source project [Projected GAN](https://github.com/autonomousvision/projected-gan) as our base code. Projected GAN is an exceptional work that allows for rapid training convergence. It was presented in a NeurIPS 2021 paper titled "Projected GANs Converge Faster" by Axel Sauer, Kashyap Chitta, Jens MÃ¼ller, and Andreas Geiger. The repository also provides a quick start Colab notebook for those interested in trying it out.

### Model Customization for Mobile Deployment

To ensure that the trained model could be efficiently deployed on mobile devices, we made some modifications to the model architecture. Specifically, we opted for the `fastgan_lite` model, which is a relatively lightweight version of the original model.

#### Code Modifications

We modified the `FastganSynthesis` class in the generator to adjust the `ngf` parameter from 128 to 64. This change effectively halved the size of the trained model without compromising the quality of generated images in our application.

Here's a snippet of the modified code:

```python
class FastganSynthesis(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ngf=64, z_dim=256, nc=3, img_resolution=256, lite=False):
        super().__init__()
        self.img_resolution = img_resolution
        self.z_dim = z_dim
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

By making these adjustments, we were able to train a model that not only converges quickly but is also optimized for mobile deployment.

## Conclusion

Implementing ImageGAN involved a series of carefully planned steps, from data collection to model training and optimization. The end result is a mobile application that leverages advanced GAN algorithms to create unique and captivating visuals. Stay tuned for future posts where we will discuss the deployment and performance optimization of ImageGAN on mobile devices.
