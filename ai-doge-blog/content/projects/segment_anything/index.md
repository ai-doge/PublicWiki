## About 

Enjoy state-of-the-art image segmentation on your iPhone or iPad.

All processing is done locally on your iphone or ipad, everything works without network.

We've optimized it for smooth, reliable performance on your device.

The implementation of Segment Anything is based on the open source SAM(Segment Anything Model).


In Pro mode, users will be able to unlock the following features:

- 1. Instead of being limited to adding only 3 "Add mask" areas, users can add up to 50 in the Pro mode.

- 2. The "Remove area" feature becomes available, providing users more flexibility and control over the image cutout process.

- 3. Users have the ability to download their cutout images, perfect for saving, sharing, or using in other applications.
